        <p>I’ve been into tech ever since I was little probably just from my Dad having lots of iMacs for his work (he’s a teacher)</p>

        <p><b>Saran#3234</b>: Hey Andrew, just curious haha, but what would you have done if YouTube didn’t take off?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Probably become a lineman, or continued working at the Mandarin Ranch I worked at before this</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>tank#0001</b>: Do you think the Apple Glass will be a success? "Revolutionary"?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>They’ll be mocked a lot at first. Everyone will have a hard time seeing the point and everyone will hate it, but eventually it will change the entire smartphone industry for sure.</p>

        <p><b>Elon Kerman#2408</b>: What is your favorite past present or future apple product and why?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>2018 iPad Pro for sure. So ahead of its time, I’m talking to you all with it right now! Biometrics are awesome, Display is great, Thin, light, fast. I want every Apple Product to be more like the iPad Pro.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>Elon Kerman#2408</b>: Who is your favorite leaker and other Apple Youtubers? Also who is your favorite Tesla youtubers?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>CoinX is my favorite leaker, I don’t watch many tech channels pretty much just MKBHD. I watch a lot of Tesla channels like Tech Forum, Dirty Tesla, Ryan Shaw Tech, i1Tesla, and more I can’t think of.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>jxndr1#9567</b>: For $400, would it be better to get a new iPhone SE or a used iPhone X?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>It probably comes down to which UI you prefer. For me personally I love Face ID and gesture control so I’d go with a Used iPhone X but if you like Touch ID and the home button better go for an SE.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>A13#4935</b>: Do you think in the next version of AirPods will give the user more control over ANC? Like controlling  how much sound it blocks out?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>They could do that via software update now but I think Apple prefers the simplicity of just ANC or Transparency mode. I rarely find myself needing something in between.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>Eli#3333</b>: With smartphone cameras getting better by the year, do you see smartphones replacing DSLR's for professional photography?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Not for a long long time. Smartphones are getting real good but still most of what they do is computational trying to mimic what DSLR’s do for real. I shoot a lot of stuff on my iPhone and it’s still miles behind what real cameras can actually do.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>Saran#3234</b>: For the longest time one negative part of the tech community has been how hostile people have treated those who use other platforms (especially in the mobile space). Do you feel that this has gotten any better lately and what do you think may eventually make this less of an issue going into the future?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Sadly no. I think it always has been a problem and it always will be. People are people, and many will always turn things into sports where we yell at each other for things that don’t really matter. All comes down to personal preferences and opinions. Best we can do is try to respect each other’s opinions.</p>
