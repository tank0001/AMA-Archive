        <h2>Guest: Rene Ritchie</h2>

        <p><b>tank#0001</b>: Hi Rene! :ablobwave: Glad to have you. How did you first get started in tech? Did you always know you wanted to do it? Did any major figures in the industry have influence?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>I got a job doing web development and then got interested in PDAs and early smartphones. I hung out on TreoCentral to learn more about the Palm Treo, they spun off a website called Phonedifferent, and I eventually began working there. Dieter Bohn, who ran it, now at the Verge, was my biggest early influence.</p>

        <p><b>OhItsReallyNoah#4759</b>: If you had to choose a 3 device starter pack for someone switching to apple, what would it be?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>So nervous! I gave my notice a month early so I could help with any March Apple event coverage, which obviously didn't happen. But then the whole shelter-in-place thing did happen and I wasn't sure if I'd just had the worst timing ever.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>DavidM#9437</b>: Hi Rene, can you describe your workflow and the tools you use to take a content idea from idea to shooting?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>I start off in Apple Notes on iPad or Mac, with Safari as a research tool. Then I write an outline and flesh it out, sometimes a little, often a lot. I shoot off that, bring the footage into Final Cut Pro X, edit the "a-roll" of me talking, add the b-roll of what I want to help make the points I'm trying to make, and then export in H.264 and upload to YouTube.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><b>Streamwood14#2389</b>: There has been some discussion that the upcoming phones released this fall will not have a charging port - is this a good move by Apple and the way of the future?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>This fall is probably too early. I expect they'll still have lightning. Next fall I think we'll see that start to shift to Smart Connectors. Lightning was good for it's time, it let Apple ship the iPhone 5 before USB-C was ready for market. But it's still a physical plug which, which can result in hardware failure. I'd love to see Smart Connectors on the mainstream models and USB-C on the Pro models, because Pro. But I think we'll get Smart Connectors with adapters going forward.</p>

        <p><b>iamchaosmikey#8894</b>: How nervous were you about going independent?</p>
        
        <blockquote>

        <p><b>n4cer#1756</b>: Hi Rene, what's your view on Jon Prosser?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>I've enjoyed his show for years. I think he works really hard at making tech news entertaining, something that I have absolutely no ability to do. (He's also incredibly supportive of other YouTubers.)</p>
