        <h2>Guest: Gregory McFadden</h2>

        <p><b>tank#0001</b>: Hi Greg! Hope you're holding up well in quarantine. How did you get started in tech? What drew you in? Industry influences? Did you always know you were going to do tech?</p>
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>Thank you, I am doing well enough even being in one of the hardest hit states right now. I've been interested in technology for basically as long as I can remember. My parents tell me I was playing Atari and Nintendo consoles with my other siblings at basically the age of 2 and I was better at it then them too! I was also drawn very heavily into the first computer I ever used which was the original 1998 iMac. I can still vividly remember bringing that computer home with my dad, plugging it in, connecting an ethernet cable, getting a popup that said we won something, and clicking on it... yeah good thing we had a Mac. I got started covering tech after I graduated college with a History degree (whoops) and I started doing my own coverage because I was unhappy with a lot of the other opinions people were expressing at the time. I have a lot of influences, probably too many to name, but my biggest ones are Walt Mossberg, Jonathan Morrison, and Rene Ritchie</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>My first piece of coverage was an unboxing of the first apple watch. I was extremely excited in the technology, and even though I had plans to enter the space for a long time, it was the first product that motivated me to cover technology. I was super excited to use a "phone like device" on my wrist, and was drawn in also by the idea that it could help monitor my activity. I weighed close to 300 pounds at the time of that unboxing, and over the years of wearing the device I managed to lose around over 100 pounds with it. Obviously, I started to cover other pieces of technology as well, from iPhone releases, Macs, iPads, and anything else that interests me.</p>
