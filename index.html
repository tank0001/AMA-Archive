        <h2>Final transcript</h2>
        
        <p><b>tank#0001</b>: Hey Andrew! How did you get started in tech? What drew you in? Did you always know what you wanted to do?</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I’ve been into tech ever since I was little probably just from my Dad having lots of iMacs for his work (he’s a teacher)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
